                    <h2>
                        CHAPTER I. THE TWO POETS OF SAFFRON PARK
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        THE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London, as red and
                        ragged as a cloud of sunset. It was built of a bright brick throughout;
                        its sky-line was fantastic, and even its ground plan was wild. It had been
                        the outburst of a speculative builder, faintly tinged with art, who called
                        its architecture sometimes Elizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne,
                        apparently under the impression that the two sovereigns were identical. It
                        was described with some justice as an artistic colony, though it never in
                        any definable way produced any art. But although its pretensions to be an
                        intellectual centre were a little vague, its pretensions to be a pleasant
                        place were quite indisputable. The stranger who looked for the first time
                        at the quaint red houses could only think how very oddly shaped the people
                        must be who could fit in to them. Nor when he met the people was he
                        disappointed in this respect. The place was not only pleasant, but
                        perfect, if once he could regard it not as a deception but rather as a
                        dream. Even if the people were not "artists," the whole was nevertheless
                        artistic. That young man with the long, auburn hair and the impudent face&mdash;that
                        young man was not really a poet; but surely he was a poem. That old
                        gentleman with the wild, white beard and the wild, white hat&mdash;that
                        venerable humbug was not really a philosopher; but at least he was the
                        cause of philosophy in others. That scientific gentleman with the bald,
                        egg-like head and the bare, bird-like neck had no real right to the airs
                        of science that he assumed. He had not discovered anything new in biology;
                        but what biological creature could he have discovered more singular than
                        himself? Thus, and thus only, the whole place had properly to be regarded;
                        it had to be considered not so much as a workshop for artists, but as a
                        frail but finished work of art. A man who stepped into its social
                        atmosphere felt as if he had stepped into a written comedy.

                        More especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about nightfall,
                        when the extravagant roofs were dark against the afterglow and the whole
                        insane village seemed as separate as a drifting cloud. This again was more
                        strongly true of the many nights of local festivity, when the little
                        gardens were often illuminated, and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the
                        dwarfish trees like some fierce and monstrous fruit. And this was
                        strongest of all on one particular evening, still vaguely remembered in
                        the locality, of which the auburn-haired poet was the hero. It was not by
                        any means the only evening of which he was the hero. On many nights those
                        passing by his little back garden might hear his high, didactic voice
                        laying down the law to men and particularly to women. The attitude of
                        women in such cases was indeed one of the paradoxes of the place. Most of
                        the women were of the kind vaguely called emancipated, and professed some
                        protest against male supremacy. Yet these new women would always pay to a
                        man the extravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him,
                        that of listening while he is talking. And Mr. Lucian Gregory, the
                        red-haired poet, was really (in some sense) a man worth listening to, even
                        if one only laughed at the end of it. He put the old cant of the
                        lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain impudent
                        freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure. He was helped in some
                        degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance, which he worked, as the
                        phrase goes, for all it was worth. His dark red hair parted in the middle
                        was literally like a woman's, and curved into the slow curls of a virgin
                        in a pre-Raphaelite picture. From within this almost saintly oval,
                        however, his face projected suddenly broad and brutal, the chin carried
                        forward with a look of cockney contempt. This combination at once tickled
                        and terrified the nerves of a neurotic population. He seemed like a
                        walking blasphemy, a blend of the angel and the ape.

                        This particular evening, if it is remembered for nothing else, will be
                        remembered in that place for its strange sunset. It looked like the end of
                        the world. All the heaven seemed covered with a quite vivid and palpable
                        plumage; you could only say that the sky was full of feathers, and of
                        feathers that almost brushed the face. Across the great part of the dome
                        they were grey, with the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an
                        unnatural pink or pale green; but towards the west the whole grew past
                        description, transparent and passionate, and the last red-hot plumes of it
                        covered up the sun like something too good to be seen. The whole was so
                        close about the earth, as to express nothing but a violent secrecy. The
                        very empyrean seemed to be a secret. It expressed that splendid smallness
                        which is the soul of local patriotism. The very sky seemed small.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening if only
                        by that oppressive sky. There are others who may remember it because it
                        marked the first appearance in the place of the second poet of Saffron
                        Park. For a long time the red-haired revolutionary had reigned without a
                        rival; it was upon the night of the sunset that his solitude suddenly
                        ended. The new poet, who introduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme
                        was a very mild-looking mortal, with a fair, pointed beard and faint,
                        yellow hair. But an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked.
                        He signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet,
                        Gregory, upon the whole nature of poetry. He said that he (Syme) was poet
                        of law, a poet of order; nay, he said he was a poet of respectability. So
                        all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he had that moment fallen out
                        of that impossible sky.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, Mr. Lucian Gregory, the anarchic poet, connected the two events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "It may well be," he said, in his sudden lyrical manner, "it may well be
                        on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth
                        upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet. You say you are a
                        poet of law; I say you are a contradiction in terms. I only wonder there
                        were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The man with the meek blue eyes and the pale, pointed beard endured these
                        thunders with a certain submissive solemnity. The third party of the
                        group, Gregory's sister Rosamond, who had her brother's braids of red
                        hair, but a kindlier face underneath them, laughed with such mixture of
                        admiration and disapproval as she gave commonly to the family oracle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gregory resumed in high oratorical good humour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "An artist is identical with an anarchist," he cried. "You might transpose
                        the words anywhere. An anarchist is an artist. The man who throws a bomb
                        is an artist, because he prefers a great moment to everything. He sees how
                        much more valuable is one burst of blazing light, one peal of perfect
                        thunder, than the mere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen. An
                        artist disregards all governments, abolishes all conventions. The poet
                        delights in disorder only. If it were not so, the most poetical thing in
                        the world would be the Underground Railway."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "So it is," said Mr. Syme.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Nonsense!" said Gregory, who was very rational when anyone else attempted
                        paradox. "Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so
                        sad and tired, so very sad and tired? I will tell you. It is because they
                        know that the train is going right. It is because they know that whatever
                        place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach. It is
                        because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next
                        station must be Victoria, and nothing but Victoria. Oh, their wild
                        rapture! oh, their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden, if the
                        next station were unaccountably Baker Street!"
